# Python-warm-up
Mini-projects used to warm-up myself up to work in Python

I completed these Dec 2019, because I wanted to start using Python for ML self-study:


1. Tic-Tac-Toe boardgame that I first thought out in Java and then ported to Python

2. Blackjack table where 1 player tries to beat the dealer, again trying to understand how OOP works in Python
